# Manapouri Inspection Device (a.k.a Subby McSubface/October/Nemo/Dory/...)#

Contained here is the code for both:
- Power Distribution Board (nano)
- Main Control Board (beaglebone black)


## Main Device Control ##

The Inspection Device is controlled by an beaglebone black interfaced to multiple sensors and 4 thrusters...

## Power Distribution Code ##

The power distribution section runs on the arduino nano and provides a programmable way of low voltage protection for the batteries. It is also able to read the current battery voltages, turn on/off the +5V rail to the sensors, and communicate to the main beaglebone board via (...).
